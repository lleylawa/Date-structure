This C++ program allows users to input two dates and performs various operations on them, including checking the validity of the dates, calculating the day of the week for each date, finding the difference in days between the two dates, and comparing which date comes earlier.

Code Overview:

Libraries: Includes <iostream> for input/output and <cmath> for mathematical functions.
Date Structure: Defines a Date structure with day, month, and year fields.

Functions:
-isValidDate: Checks if a given date is valid, considering the number of days in each month and accounting for leap years.
-getDayOfWeek: Calculates the day of the week for a given date using Zeller's Congruence algorithm.
-calculateDifference: Computes the difference in days between two dates by converting each date into days and then finding the absolute difference.
-printDate: Prints a date in a formatted way.
-operator<: Overloads the less than operator for comparing dates.

Main Function:
Declares two Date variables (date1 and date2).
Prompts the user to input both dates.
Checks the validity of the entered dates.
Prints the entered dates.
Calculates and prints the day of the week for each date.
Calculates and prints the difference in days between the two dates.
Compares the dates and prints which one comes earlier.
